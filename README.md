# Getting Started

1. Get this repository: `git clone https://github.com/EvolveU-FSD/c8-rock-paper-scissors`
2. Have NPM fetch the dependencies listed in package.json: `npm install`
3. Run the program: `node index.js`

# Ideas for experimenting

- get names of player 1 and 2
- handle "bad input" from a player
- limit the input choices for a player
- automatically re-play a match when there is a draw
- have the program support "best of 7 matches"




# Project1.01
Project1.01-squash-game
Get this repository: `https://github.com/neu4mann/Project1.01.git`
1. run mild.js
2. Run the program node mild.js



Main files = mild.js 

----------------------------------------------Project Steps---------------------------------------
install NVM
install git bash
install node

mkdir 



Creat git hub repo - readmefile
git bash git clone repo https://github.com/neu4mann/Project1.01.git
git bash npm install - installs JSON - creates package.json  
npm init -y accepts all defaults
git bash cat package.json shows file name etc..
git bash code . runs current dir to visual studio code

git bash npm install readline-sync adds Node_modules updates JSON
npmjs.com for readline-sync add json loc file
git bash npm install express

create sandboxes

http://localhost:4000/
// check server switch require same name as game file


//folder with no sync
ls/d/programtools/
//Server project build
npm init -y jSON depends on express
npm install express
cat package.json
ls node_modules
npm install nodemon      npm install -g nodemon # or using yarn: yarn global add nodemon - keeps server going https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon?msclkid=69cb2580aa0211ec8cf28cfe2a40b178


//---------------------------------Create Server Express---------------------

https://gist.github.com/gregfenton https://gist.github.com/gregfenton/6660d8541ecf6de84a1e2bf75809326f
Create varaible 
//Server http://localhost:4000
const app = express();
const PORT = 4000;

#**************iBackend.Game******************

iCoders Compile!

If you correctly select the correct answers for 3 or more out of the 5 questions, you can stop iThanos from The iBlip in the backend.Game! Save half of the earth's population from vanishing, do not let iThanos snap his fingers! 

Collect as many INFINITY Codes as you can. Know your codes or let your friends die.

1.
 iIronman flies up and lands on the hellicarrier and kills a Chitauri lieutenant of Loki's army. A tablet is seen in the dead creatures hands. iIronman does an object scan with J.A.R.V.I.S. on the tablet and instantly knows what to do.

To access the tablet for the MIND Code you need to Choose A or B:

"function myObject(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}"

A) JS Function.
B) JS Object

2.
iSpider-Man swings to the top of the Avengers tower building where the portal machine is powering up.
He sees a tablet laying by the portal machine. Swoooosh-ppppffffft goes the web as iSpider-man fishes the tablet with his wrist webbing. The iSpidey sense tingle.

To access the tablet for the POWER Code.  Choose A or B:

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

A) JS Arrays.
B) JS Array Methods

3.
iHulk jumps up to the top of iTony Starks building smashing through the balcony glass landing on Loki.
Loki is knocked unconscious and drops his tablet. The inner iDavid Banner senses the importance of the tablet.

To access the tablet for the REALITY Code. Choose A or B:

let x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
let y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
let z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)

A) JS Operators.
B) JS Arithmetic

4.
iCaptain America frisbee's his shield and beheads some bad guy. Cool! Give me more of that violence.
iCaptain America see's a tablet in the knapsack of the headless corpse. Make CODE great again!

<element event="some JavaScript">

A) JS Events.

5.
iThor raises his hammer and musters up a sh*t-load of electrical energy from the sky. Cool etime! 10 year-old director delivers action like never before! iThor focuses the energy towards a fighting front of Loki's army and the behemoth Galactus mid-way of the army. 
iThor (handsome guy- his long-hair bothers me!) shoots his electrical energy towards the bad guys. 
Everyone collapses, while Galactus falls forward further crushing his own men. 

In the end, a tablet slides towards iThors feet in an ever so cool slow-motion ending scene shot. IThor eyes the tablet and squints.

Scoring

A- Correct you got the INFINITY Code
B- Wrong you did not get a INFINITY Code

=3> greater= You got enough INFINITY CODEs to save from The iBLIP!
		   Everybody Celebrates!
<3 or less    = !!You FAILED!! You did not get enough INIFINITY Code's together.
 iThanos snaps his fingers.
 THE iBLIP HAPPENS, you feel like poo. Guilt, depression and funny feelings get you down. 
Those old familiar neuropathways are once again reinforced (Thanks for reminding us Margo).
Half of the InceptionU Class disappears. 
You suck.
